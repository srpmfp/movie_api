# Movie API

An Api to Create, login, and update new users giving them access to the movies housed in a mongoDB database.


### Technologies Leveraged:
---
- <b>Passport</b>
    - Used to authenticate JWT tokens and verify users. 
- <b>Mongoose </b>
    - Used to define schemas, validate data, and store structured documents in MongoDB.
- <b>Express</b>
    - used to handle HTTP routing, requests, and responses
- <b>jsonwebtoken</b>
    - used to create JWT tokens

### Future states
---
* create endpoints for comments and feedback
* create oAuth verification with google calendar to enable viewing parties
* add to movie schema a count of how many people have added the movie to their favorites
* User upvote downvote schema and endpoint to allow for more interaction with movies and their added information.


### Take aways from project

As this was an early project in my course, the structuring of the API was a lot more facilitated versus the end of the course.<br>
What was nice was coming back in to edit, rearrange, or change some of the logic and schema to fit. Coming back <br>
was a shot in the arm because it really showed how much growth had been accomplished from beginning to now.
